General_Info
============

General info section for LoL Helper


All changes will be made to this repository until the section is finished in its entirety. 


To add to ViewChampion.java, 

1. edit strings.xml in res > values > strings.xml with new champion names. Follow suit. FINISHED FOR CHAMPIONS
2. add on to the if-statement chain starting at line 49. Again, follow suit.
3. add on to the switch-statement immediately after the if-statement chain previously worked on. Again, again, follow suit. We'll discuss multiple icons for spells later, but for now just put one icon and we'll decide if we have enough time to implement everything.
    I know it's not exactly what we want, but I'd rather have more general content right now than very specific accuracy only important to a few champions.

Once this is completed we will work on getting spell information to show. Like I said in the email, it's very confusing to look at. 


I'll add to this when we get around to making the ViewItem.java and ViewSummonerSpell.java
